Codewriting

You are developing an application for mathematical expressions evaluation using vanilla JS.

On the preview page you can see the following elements:

The form with a single input for submitting a number â€” number of tokens in the expression
The button to evaluate the expression.
The field where the answer will appear.
If a positive number n is entered into the form and the Make expression button is clicked, then n input boxes appear on the screen. 
Each box may contain at most one character. Allowed characters are numerals (0 - 9), and basic operations (+, -, * and /).
